  `Auto racing, also known as car racing, is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition. It has existed since the invention of the automobile. Races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines.`,
  `Bees are hardwired to do certain jobs. Scout bees, which search for new sources of food, are wired for adventure. Soldier bees, discovered in 2012, work as security guards their whole life. One percent of all middle-aged bees become undertakers - a genetic brain pattern compels them to remove dead bees from the hive. But most amazingly, regular honeybees, which perform multiple jobs in their lifetime, will change their brain chemistry before taking up a new gig.`,
  `Created thousands of years ago, Greek myths were epic stories about Greek gods, passed down over generations. They often feature heroic battles and terrible creatures, and taught the importance of bravery, intelligence, and right and wrong. They showed that even the gods, like mortal men, could be punished or rewarded for their actions. Details of the ancient tales have been found on everything from pottery to temples to stone statues!`,
  `Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonist who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. He led the first European expeditions to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the Americas, a continent which was not then known to the Old World. While what he thought he saw was Far East, he is credited with the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans.`,
  `Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato also appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle.`,
  `Guinea pigs are large rodents. They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years. Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they cannot climb, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and will either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.`,
